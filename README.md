About the Project

In this Project we have developed a programmable finite state machine library using which an application can initiate
a specific FSM object and use it for FSM based problem solving like pattern matching, validation or computation.
This program is designed to simulate the working of a FSM with the help of C programming constructs.
This project consists of a working and functional C-Library which contains the structures and application 
programming interface required to execute any finite state machine, and three application c programs 
to validate the input and provide appropriate output.
